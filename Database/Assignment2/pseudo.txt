Method movePlayerToCell(x, y, playerId):
    key = String.format("%d-%c%d", playerId, x, y)
    check Load Factor
    if (load factor > threshold):
        resize hash table;
    if (player moves to a different cell):
        entryTime = Current local time
        if (playerMap does not contain key):
            create entry for playerMap with key and initialize the time to 0
            check if other players are in the cell
            calculate time spent in the cell using getTimeSpent(entryTime) algorithm
        else:
            calculate time spent in the cell using getTimeSpent(entryTime) algorithm

Method checkForPlayersInSameCell():
    for every active player // Player with no exit time
        parse key at '-' and store xy value;
        if xy values match:
            players share the same cell at the same time

Method getTimeSpent(entryTime):
    Calculate timeSpent by subtracting entryTime from the current local time
    Return timeSpent as a float representing the time in seconds
